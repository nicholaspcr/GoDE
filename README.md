# GoDE

GoDE is a personal project currently under active development, so its features
and direction may change significantly. This document outlines the project's
core concept and goals.

This project extends the [GDE3](https://github.com/nicholaspcr/GDE3) initiative,
which originated from a scientific research endeavor at
[CEFET-MG](https://www.cefetmg.br/). The primary goal of GoDE is to build upon
the existing work on heuristic performance.

Key planned enhancements include refactoring the executable into a server and a
Command Line Interface (CLI). This will enable multiple users to concurrently
request and run distinct Differential Evolutionary (DE) instances on a single
server. Other potential additions involve front-end interfaces and a SQL
database. Suggestions for further development are welcome.

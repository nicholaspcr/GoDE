# GoDE

This is a personal project and is subject to drastic changes at any time, the
contents below describe the idea behind this repository and what is all about.

This is an extension of the [GDE3](https://github.com/nicholaspcr/GDE3) project
developed for a scientific research project in the university of
[CEFET-MG](https://www.cefetmg.br/). The main purpose of this project is to take
a chance of developing on top of the work done regarding the heuristics
performances.


The main idea around what is going to be added is the separation of the
executable into a server and a CLI, allowing for multiple people to make
requests to run distinct Differential Evolutionary (DE) instances in a single
server. A few other things will be added, with the possible inclusion of
front-end pages and a SQL database, suggestions are more than welcome.
